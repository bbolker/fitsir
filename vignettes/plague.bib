                   have drastically expanded the scope of genetic
                   analyses of ancient specimens to the extent that full
                   genomic investigations are now feasible and are
                   quickly becoming standard(1). This trend has
                   important implications for infectious disease
                   research because genomic data from ancient microbes
                   may help to elucidate mechanisms of pathogen
                   evolution and adaptation for emerging and re-emerging
                   infections. Here we report a reconstructed ancient
                   genome of Yersinia pestis at 30-fold average coverage
                   from Black Death victims securely dated to episodes
                   of pestilence-associated mortality in London,
                   England, 1348-1350. Genetic architecture and
                   phylogenetic analysis indicate that the ancient
                   organismis ancestral to most extant strains and sits
                   very close to the ancestral node of all Y. pestis
                   commonly associated with human infection. Temporal
                   estimates suggest that the Black Death of 1347-1351
                   was the main historical event responsible for the
                   introduction and widespread dissemination of the
                   ancestor to all currently circulating Y. pestis
                   strains pathogenic to humans, and further indicates
                   that contemporary Y. pestis epidemics have their
                   origins in the medieval era. Comparisons against
                   modern genomes reveal no unique derived positions in
                   the medieval organism, indicating that the perceived
                   increased virulence of the disease during the Black
                   Death may not have been due to bacterial phenotype.
                   These findings support the notion that factors other
                   than microbial genetics, such as environment, vector
                   dynamics and host susceptibility, should be at the
                   forefront of epidemiological discussions regarding
                   emerging Y. pestis infections.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Yersinia pestis has caused at least three
                   human plague pandemics. The second (Black Death,
                   14--17th centuries) and third (19--20th centuries)
                   have been genetically characterised, but there is
                   only a limited understanding of the first pandemic,
                   the Plague of Justinian (6-8th centuries). To address
                   this gap, we sequenced and analysed draft genomes of
                   Y pestis obtained from two individuals who died in
                   the first pandemic. METHODS: Teeth were removed from
                   two individuals (known as A120 and A76) from the
                   early medieval Aschheim-Bajuwarenring cemetery
                   (Aschheim, Bavaria, Germany). We isolated DNA from
                   the teeth using a modified phenol-chloroform method.
                   We screened DNA extracts for the presence of the Y
                   pestis-specific pla gene on the pPCP1 plasmid using
                   primers and standards from an established assay,
                   enriched the DNA, and then sequenced it. We
                   reconstructed draft genomes of the infectious Y
                   pestis strains, compared them with a database of
                   genomes from 131 Y pestis strains from the second and
                   third pandemics, and constructed a maximum likelihood
                   phylogenetic tree. FINDINGS: Radiocarbon dating of
                   both individuals (A120 to 533 AD [plus or minus 98
                   years]; A76 to 504 AD [plus or minus 61 years])
                   places them in the timeframe of the first pandemic.
                   Our phylogeny contains a novel branch (100\%
                   bootstrap at all relevant nodes) leading to the two
                   Justinian samples. This branch has no known
                   contemporary representatives, and thus is either
                   extinct or unsampled in wild rodent reservoirs. The
                   Justinian branch is interleaved between two extant
                   groups, 0.ANT1 and 0.ANT2, and is distant from
                   strains associated with the second and third
                   pandemics. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that the Y
                   pestis lineages that caused the Plague of Justinian
                   and the Black Death 800 years later were independent
                   emergences from rodents into human beings. These
                   results show that rodent species worldwide represent
                   important reservoirs for the repeated emergence of
                   diverse lineages of Y pestis into human populations.

                   an important measure of disease spread, and is
                   commonly used to infer the basic reproduction number
                   [Formula: see text]. While modern techniques (e.g.,
                   MCMC and particle filtering) for parameter estimation
                   of mechanistic models have gained popularity, maximum
                   likelihood fitting of phenomenological models remains
                   important due to its simplicity, to the difficulty of
                   using modern methods in the context of limited data,
                   and to the fact that there is not always enough
                   information available to choose an appropriate
                   mechanistic model. However, it is often not clear
                   which phenomenological model is appropriate for a
                   given dataset. We compare the performance of four
                   commonly used phenomenological models (exponential,
                   Richards, logistic, and delayed logistic) in
                   estimating initial epidemic growth rates by maximum
                   likelihood, by fitting them to simulated epidemics
                   with known parameters. For incidence data, both the
                   logistic model and the Richards model yield accurate
                   point estimates for fitting windows up to the
                   epidemic peak. When observation errors are small, the
                   Richards model yields confidence intervals with
                   better coverage. For mortality data, the Richards
                   model and the delayed logistic model yield the best
                   growth rate estimates. We also investigate the width
                   and coverage of the confidence intervals
                   corresponding to these fits.},

                   control of emerging infectious diseases. A key
                   variable in such models is the reproductive number R.
                   For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of
                   the reproductive number can only be inferred
                   indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic
                   growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several
                   different equations exist that relate the
                   reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is
                   unclear which of these equations might apply to a new
                   infection. Here, we show that these different
                   equations differ only with respect to their assumed
                   shape of the generation interval distribution.
                   Therefore, the shape of the generation interval
                   distribution determines which equation is appropriate
                   for inferring the reproductive number from the
                   observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all
                   generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we
                   obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values
                   that the reproductive number may attain for a given
                   growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the
                   generation interval distribution equal to the
                   observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an
                   empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

                   past outbreaks that shows that the average number of
                   secondary cases per primary case (R-0) was 1.3
                   (variance = 3.1), assuming a geometric probability
                   distribution, prior to outbreak control measures. We
                   also show that the latent and infectious periods can
                   be approximated by using lognormal distributions with
                   means (SD) of 4.3 (1.8) and 2.5 (1.2) days. Based on
                   this parameter estimation, we construct a
                   Markov-chain epidemic model to demonstrate the
                   potential impact of delays in implementing outbreak
                   control measures and increasing numbers of index
                   cases on the incidence of cases in simulated
                   outbreaks.},

  abstract =      {The well-known formula for the final size of an
                   epidemic was published by Kermack and McKendrick in
                   1927. Their analysis was based on a simple
                   susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that
                   assumes exponentially distributed infectious periods.
                   More recent analyses have established that the
                   standard final size formula is valid regardless of
                   the distribution of infectious periods, but that it
                   fails to be correct in the presence of certain kinds
                   of heterogeneous mixing (e.g., if there is a core
                   group, as for sexually transmitted diseases). We
                   review previous work and establish more general
                   conditions under which Kermack and McKendrick's
                   formula is valid. We show that the final size formula
                   is unchanged if there is a latent stage, any number
                   of distinct infectious stages and/or a stage during
                   which infectives are isolated (the durations of each
                   stage can be drawn from any integrable distribution).
                   We also consider the possibility that the
                   transmission rates of infectious Individuals are
                   arbitrarily distributed-allowing, in particular, for
                   the existence of super-spreaders-and prove that this
                   potential complexity has no impact on the final Size
                   formula. Finally. we show that the final size formula
                   is unchanged even for a General class of spatial
                   contact structures. We conclude that whenever a new
                   respiratory pathogen emerges, an estimate of the
                   expected magnitude of the epidemic can be made as
                   soon the basic reproduction number R-0 can be
                   approximated, and this estimate is likely to be
                   improved only by more accurate estimates of R-0 not
                   by knowledge of any other epidemiological details.},

                   used to predict the spread of infectious diseases in
                   populations. Successful analysis and modeling of
                   historical infectious disease data can explain
                   changes in the pattern of past epidemics and lead to
                   a better understanding of epidemiological processes.
                   The lessons learned can be used to predict future
                   epidemics and help to improve public healthstrategies
                   for control and eradication. This thesis is focused
                   on the analysis and modelling of smallpox dynamics
                   based on the weekly smallpox mortality records in
                   London, England, 1664--1930. Statistical analysis of
                   these records is presented. A timeline of significant
                   historical events related to changes in variolation
                   and vaccination uptake levels and demographics was
                   established. These events were correlated with
                   transitions observed in smallpox dynamics.
                   Seasonality of the smallpox time series was
                   investigated and the contact rate between susceptible
                   and infectious individuals was found to be seasonally
                   forced. Seasonal variations in smallpox transmission
                   and changes in their seasonality over long time scale
                   were estimated. The method of transition analysis,
                   which is used to predict qualitative changes in
                   epidemiological patterns, was used to explain the
                   transitions observed in the smallpox time series. We
                   found that the standard SIR model exhibits dynamics
                   similar to the more realistic Gamma distributed SEIR
                   model if the mean serial interval is chosen the same,
                   so we used the standard SIR model for our analysis.
                   We conclude that transitions observed in the temporal
                   pattern of smallpox dynamics can be explained by the
                   changes in birth, immigration and intervention uptake
                   levels.},

                   deaths worldwide and subsequently changed history,
                   not the least during the period of the Black Death.
                   Of the three plague pandemics, the third is believed
                   to have originated in China. Using the spatial and
                   temporal human plague records in China from 1850 to
                   1964, we investigated the association of human plague
                   intensity (plague cases per year) with proxy data on
                   climate condition (specifically an index for
                   dryness/wetness). Our modeling analysis demonstrates
                   that the responses of plague intensity to dry/wet
                   conditions were different in northern and southern
                   China. In northern China, plague intensity generally
                   increased when wetness increased, for both the
                   current and the previous year, except for low
                   intensity during extremely wet conditions in the
                   current year (reflecting a dome-shaped response to
                   current-year dryness/ wetness). In southern China,
                   plague intensity generally decreased when wetness
                   increased, except for high intensity during extremely
                   wet conditions of the current year. These opposite
                   effects are likely related to the different climates
                   and rodent communities in the two parts of China: In
                   northern China (arid climate), rodents are expected
                   to respond positively to high precipitation, whereas
                   in southern China (humid climate), high precipitation
                   is likely to have a negative effect. Our results
                   suggest that associations between human plague
                   intensity and precipitation are nonlinear: positive
                   in dry conditions, but negative in wet conditions.},

                   limitations have prevented large-scale genomic
                   investigations to evaluate changes in the pathogen's
                   virulence over time. We screened over 100 skeletal
                   remains from Black Death victims of the East
                   Smithfield mass burial site (1348-1350, London,

                   mitochondrial genomes (16 kb each) and the full pPCP1
                   (9.6 kb) virulence-associated plasmid at high

                   reconstructed plasmid against modern Y. pestis shows

                   Medievalis biovar; however, our chromosomal sequences
                   indicate the victims were infected with a Y. pestis
                   variant that has not been previously reported. Our
                   data reveal that the Black Death in medieval Europe
                   was caused by a variant of Y. pestis that may no
                   longer exist, and genetic data carried on its pPCP1
                   plasmid were not responsible for the purported
                   epidemiological differences between ancient and
                   modern forms of Y. pestis infections.},

                   Noble of 1974 did not originate full spatiotemporal
                   2D simulations. The present model incorporates a new

                   between contagion and short range dislocations. The
                   contagion rate term is modified to account for
                   saturation effects in the contact rate. The model and
                   parameters used very nearly reproduce important
                   features of the spatiotemporal evolution of the Black
                   Death, the calculated global mortality attaining a
                   very large fraction of the European population.},

  abstract =      {Multiple transmission pathways exist for many
                   waterborne diseases, including cholera, Giardia,
                   Cryptosporidium, and Campylobacter. Theoretical work
                   exploring the effects of multiple transmission
                   pathways on disease dynamics is incomplete. Here, we
                   consider a simple ODE model that extends the
                   classical SIR framework by adding a compartment (W )
                   that tracks pathogen concentration in the water.
                   Infected individuals shed pathogen into the water
                   compartment, and new infections arise both through
                   exposure to contaminated water, as well as by the
                   classical SIR person--person transmission pathway. We
                   compute the basic reproductive number (R0), epidemic
                   growth rate, and final outbreak size for the
                   resulting "SIWR" model, and examine how these
                   fundamental quantities depend upon the transmission
                   parameters for the different pathways. We prove that
                   the endemic disease equilibrium for the SIWR model is
                   globally stable. We identify the pathogen decay rate
                   in the water compartment as a key parameter
                   determining when the distinction between the
                   different transmission routes in the SIWR model is
                   important. When the decay rate is slow, using an SIR
                   model rather than the SIWR model can lead to
                   under-estimates of the basic reproductive number and
                   over-estimates of the infectious period.},

                   seasonal, with peak mortality almost always in the
                   summer, (ii) the only non--summer outbreaks occurred
                   in the spring of 1832, the autumn of 1848 and the
                   winter of 1853, and (iii) extraordinarily severe
                   summer outbreaks occurred in 1832, 1849, 1854 and
                   1866 (the four 'great' cholera years). The
                   non--summer outbreaks of 1832, 1848 and 1853 appear
                   to have been herald waves of newly invading cholera
                   strains. In addition, a simple mathematical model
                   confirms that a non--summer introduction of a new
                   cholera strain can result in an initial herald wave,
                   followed by a severe outbreak the following summer.
                   Through the analysis of the genomes of
                   nineteenth--century specimens, it may be possible to
                   identify the strains that caused these herald waves
                   and the well--known cholera epidemics that followed.},
