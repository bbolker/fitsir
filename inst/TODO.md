To do
==========

Lots and lots.

* think a lot about the interface: how to optimize efficiency, flexibility, breadth, transparency, simplicity ... ?  Want simple model objects (S3 class) that allow simple summaries, diagnostics, fits ... extend `mle2` class?
* allow neg binomial rather than least-squares fit?
* implement fitting based on incidence rather than prevalence?
* flexibility in models?
* throw in old BIRS erlangSEIR stuff?
* gradient matching?
* state-space models: pomp, JAGS, etc. ?
* tie-in with Tiff Bogich's "Plom" stuff?
* tie-in with other epi R packages: `EpiModel`, `EpiDynamics` ...
* fix Bombay data fitting!
